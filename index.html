<p>    <---this is me!</p>
  <p>I lived on the Upper West side for most of my life, until COVID, when I moved to Colts Neck, 
    NJ for 3 years. I hated living in NJ, so when I was 14 my parents allowed me to move back to the city.
     I applied and got into LaGuardia, and now I live on the UWS in our old apartment, with my moms friend, and I go 
     back to NJ on the weekends.</p>
